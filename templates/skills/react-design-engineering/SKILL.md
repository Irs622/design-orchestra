# React design engineering

Do not begin implementation until a SelectionV1 exists. Preserve the detected
framework, installed component system, real brand assets, and project
conventions. Do not alter DESIGN.md; write a page-specific specification.

Implement the approved section sequence and navigation pattern, not a generic
template header. Do not add a green live dot, fake activity popup, showcase
badge, status pill, or invented notification. Badges require verified,
user-supplied meaning.

Do not stack unrequested blur, translucent cards, noise/mesh backgrounds,
gradient CTAs, rounded card grids, and default display typography. Implement
the selected design system with deliberate surfaces, hierarchy, and content
grouping. A decorative effect must clarify the brand or user task; otherwise
remove it.

Build semantic landmarks, logical heading levels, real buttons and links,
keyboard navigation, visible focus indicators, and responsive layouts that
reflow at 320px. Use CSS variables/tokens for the approved palette, type,
spacing, and surface system. Set image dimensions, responsive sources, and
descriptive alt text.

Implement the page-specific system as semantic roles, not a collection of
unrelated components. Keep the offer, proof, and primary action understandable
without scripts, animation, or a high-bandwidth asset. Test narrow layouts,
long content, 200% zoom, and the selected navigation behavior before polish.

Ask the user which animation technology to use before implementation: CSS-only,
Framer Motion, GSAP, 3D, or no motion. CSS is preferred for simple transitions.
Use Framer Motion, GSAP, or 3D only when chosen and already installed, or after
the user approves adding it. Follow [animation and 3D craft](references/animation-and-3d-craft.md)
for GPU performance, camera constraints, bundle splitting, and prefers-reduced-motion
compliance; never make animation essential to comprehension or interaction.

Use exactly one icon library per page. Lucide React or React Icons are allowed.
Ban handwritten SVG markup and standalone SVG icon files.
