# Design Orchestra

Route the request to one of four modes: **create**, **redesign**, **critique**,
or **polish**. This skill governs the workflow; do not skip its gates.

## Non-negotiable flow

1. Inspect the repository, framework, existing component system, brand assets,
   DESIGN.md, page content, and any supplied evidence.
2. Research the product idea and its category. Look for the product's existing
   moodboards, brand references, or visual language before creating something
   new. Synthesize findings; never imitate a competitor.
3. Ask one structured question round for only unresolved facts: goal, audience,
   offer, CTA, proof, brand constraints, desired feeling, anti-references,
   media preference, palette, design family, required sections, navigation
   pattern, and animation technology. Do not begin concept work before this
   round has been answered or the user explicitly delegates the choices.
4. Give a user-supplied palette priority. If none is supplied, research
   product-appropriate palettes using Color Hunt or another current curated
   palette source when web access is available. Record the source, test the
   applied pairs for contrast, and present the selected palette for approval.
5. Explicitly ask the user to choose **CSS-only**, **Framer Motion**, **GSAP**,
   **3D**, or **no motion**. CSS is the safe default only after the user agrees.
6. Create a valid BriefV1, a cryptographically random seed (unless supplied),
   and exactly three diverse DirectionV1 candidates. Use the visual-direction
   skill, read [the experience quality bar](references/experience-quality-bar.md),
   and render a self-contained gallery.
7. Present the three candidates and wait for an explicit selection. Do not edit
   the landing page before selection.
8. Implement the selected system, then run independent strategy, visual,
   accessibility, responsive, and performance review.
9. Iterate until quality gates pass. If all directions are rejected, use
   feedback plus a fresh seed and create three new candidates.

## Choice-driven brief

Offer compact, relevant choices rather than making the page from a generic
landing-page recipe. Let the user select or describe:

- **Design family:** functional, editorial, warm humanist, Swiss, bento,
  glass, soft-dimensional, maximalist collage, neo-brutalist, luxury,
  cinematic, or another brief-appropriate archetype.
- **Layout paradigm:** Asymmetrical split, editorial masthead, dynamic bento,
  monumental typographic rhythm, live terminal/sandbox, chaptered narrative,
  utility control deck, or bifurcated comparative canvas (from layout-paradigms skill).
- **Content sections:** hero, proof, feature explanation, product demo,
  process, comparison, pricing, FAQ, testimonials only when genuine, contact,
  newsletter, or an intentionally smaller sequence.
- **Navigation behavior:** no persistent navigation, editorial masthead,
  compact utility bar, centered mark, split navigation, full-screen menu, or
  another purpose-fit pattern.
- **Motion:** CSS-only, Framer Motion, GSAP, 3D, or no motion, plus whether it
  should feel quiet, playful, cinematic, kinetic, or still.
- **Avoid list:** ask which familiar patterns the user does not want to see,
  such as frosted panels, blurred/mesh backgrounds, pill badges, a centred
  hero, equal feature cards, a persistent CTA, or an oversized display face.

Avoid stereotypical AI chrome unless it is real product information and the
user selects it: no decorative "live" green status dots, fake activity
notifications, "showcase" pills, generic availability badges, or default
three-link-plus-CTA navigation. A badge is permissible only when it conveys a
verified, necessary status or category.

Do not replace these with a new house style. Every visual decision needs a
brief-specific reason: a real content relationship, brand trait, user task, or
chosen art direction. Read the anti-generic audit in the design-review skill
when a concept risks feeling generated or repetitive.

Before presenting directions, use the experience quality bar to verify that
the offer, proof, and next action remain clear without decorative effects.

Where subagents exist, delegate strategy, exploration, and review independently.
On hosts without subagents, perform the same phases sequentially and label the
independence of each review.

## Redesign rules

Treat existing DESIGN.md as authority. Never overwrite it; create a
page-specific specification unless the user explicitly asks for a merge.
Preserve real brand assets and the existing component system. Separate observed
problems from assumptions and never fabricate proof.

## Required artifacts

- BriefV1 before concepts.
- One DirectionV1 for every candidate.
- SelectionV1 before implementation.
- AssetLedgerV1 for all non-CSS visual assets.
- A page-specific design specification that records the approved direction and
  chosen animation technology.
